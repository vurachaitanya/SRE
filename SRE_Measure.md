## How to Measure & What to Measure

#### Devop’s five pillars:
-	Reduce organization silos
-	Accepts failure as normal
-	Implement gradual changes
-	Leverage tooling and automation
-	Measure everything


#### How to measure for Reliability: SLI’s
-	SLI’s are the one which should be measured.

-	What are we measuring: **Everything**

-	How are we measuring
-	- Uptime: the rate at which the system is available
-	- Request success rate: the ratio of successful requests compared to failed requests.
-	- Latency: the rate of latency or wait time.
-	- Utilization: the amount of resources being utilized. 

-	What interval we are measuring – Quarterly.

-	How do we reach our SLO’s:
-	- Incident management process: A good incident management processes helps identify problem areas.
-	- Blameless postmortems: helps identify root cause and creates a culture of blamelessness.

-	Reaching four nines is great achievement 99% to 99.999% 

-	**Redundant systems:**   Ensure redundancy in the event of unplanned outages and to eliminate single points of failure.
-	**Consider cost:** Ensure redundancy in the event of unplanned outages and to eliminate single points of failure. 


#### Reviewing the tools for SRE:
-	**Automation** automation prevents human error and speeds up processing.
-	**Monitoring and alerting** Monitoring alerts the SRE to issues with the product, such as availability or opportunities for optimization. 
-	**Incident Management** Monitoring alerts the SRE to issues with the product, such as availability or opportunities of optimization. 
-	**Incident Review** Incident review enables the SRE to identify the root cause of an issue and ensures it doesn’t happen again. 
-	**Problem Management** Problem management allows the SRE to track resolutions to issues.
-	**Change Management** It allows SRE to track changes made to systems as well as deployments. 
-	**Software Development Tools** software Development tools allow the SRE to track the progress of the product as well as provide bug tracking and product backlogs.
