# SRE
#### SRE Role :
-	SRE is an intersection of Software Engineering and IT Operations.
-	SRE are responsible for the full technology stack for their product. 
-	SRE incorporate software Engg experience with system administration and networking skills sets.
-	SRE are dedicated to increasing the performance and reliability of their products. 
-	He should be responsible for system uptime, system performance, latency, Incident, change management, system & application monitoring, capacity planning. 
-	Books **Site reliability Engineering: How google runs production systems** & **The Site reliability workbook: Practical ways to implements the SRE**
-	**SRE Engg** = Software Engg + System Admin + Networking experience. 
-	**Roles:** 50% time spent on operation duties like incident & oncall & 50% time spend on Programming, Increasing performance reliability and automation.
-	**Measures:** Identify & measure key reliability metrics, including service level indicators, service level objectives and service level agreements. 
#### SRE Philosophy
-	Keep system up and available 24X7X365 days.
-	Be quick to respond and cheap to repair.
-	Hire Engineer with software development experience.
-	Takes responsibility for service reliability.
-	Products maintain a high standards or reliability. 
-	Can laterally move across teams and projects. 
-	**Embrace Risk:** We know that failures will occur. Instead of trying to  eliminate the risk completely, we embrace the risk and quantify that a certain amount of downtime is tolerable. 
-	**Eliminate Point failure:** we can eliminate single points of failure.
-	**Graceful Degradation :** We can write code that detects service failures and adapts the service accordingly. This way we can keep critical services up and running.
-	Required Items: 
-	- reliability
-	- Measure everything
-	- Alerting
-	- Leverage automation
-	- implement small more frequent changes
-	- Embrace risk

#### Compare Devops vs SRE
-	SRE defines how to use devops methodology  
-	Reduce organization silos
-	Accepts failures as normal
-	Implement gradual changes
-	Leverage tooling and automation 
-	Measure everything
-	Devops | SRE
-	Identifies issues for development to resolve| finds issues in production and resolves them themselves 
-	Leaves production untouched | comfortable deploying to and making changes in production 
-	Generally, stay within Development | Can Move across and between development and production teams.
-	Gets products to production faster | manages the production environment.
